{"body":"Morses Secret Technology\r\n======================\r\n\r\nMorses Secret Technology, the Exquisite Corpse of Open Hardware.\r\n\r\nWhy\r\n====\r\nThere is a form of story telling called [The Exquisite Corps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse) it has \r\ntraditionally been performed as drawing a part of picutre, and folding it so the only a few lines of the image remain\r\nso they can be extended by the next person. No one can really see the whole, but everyone can add a part. This \r\nalso has been adapted to a story telling technique of writing several sentences, and then folding the paper, and \r\nhand it to the next person to continue the story.\r\n\r\nOpen Hardware is in many ways like the Exquisite Corpse technique of story telling. So in the case of Morses Secrete\r\nTechnology the idea is that this is all Open Hardware, and Open Software. There is a Steampunk style theme, but \r\neveryone is allowed to fork the project, and use the technology to tell their own tales.\r\n\r\nI love paradoxes, and irony so I'm looking forward to see what stories we tell using Morse's Secret Technology.\r\n\r\nCurrent Projects:\r\n======\r\n* [Morse's Secret Blocks](https://github.com/ricklon/MorsesSecret)\r\n* [Morse's Autotelegrapher](https://github.com/ricklon/Autotelegrapher)\r\n* [Morse's Messenger](https://github.com/ricklon/VictorianBoxBot) // Victorian Robot\r\n* [Morse's Dome](https://github.com/ricklon/MorseDome)\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
